##Summary of Sanjay Paul view on investment.
* On the base of [Efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), the price of assets in the market accurately reflect their true underlying value, according to all presently available information. And Sanjay Paul interpreted this as **active trading is the equivalent of gambling** since all publicly available information has already been incorporated into the price you pay, you ca't possibly make a more accurate prediction than what the market has already achieved.__You don’t need to try and “beat the market.” You only need to match the market, something that is surprisingly difficult to do__.

* __The average, traditional retail investor(like me) with limited time, money and access to information doesn't really stand a chance in the market__. The Statistics supporting this [position](http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/articles/2012/10/12/study-active-funds-consistently-fail-to-beat-benchmarks). That article details how 90% of professional mutual fund managers couldn't beat the performance of the S&P 500. __You don't need to beat the market, just try to match the market, which is still difficult.__
* Market obeys the [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), means the majority of the money is being moved by minority of participants(Wall Shreet). That means average investor doesn't matter much and they are at huge disadvantage against who trade full-time.
* __Those people who actively trade are of course at the much higher risk of failing to beat the market than those who attempt to simply match it__. Based on the effort and time you spend, even if you beat the market, you have to beat by high percentage, else it doesn't worth it.
* Do Asset allocation and Modern portfolio theory.
*

###Notes
* __Know Price you pay vs Value you get.__ So have good error of margin.
